---------------
Quick starting the bot
---------------

Pretty simple IRC bot in python. You can create multiple bots that run
on multiple servers, use multiple access lists or just one, all up to 
you.

To create a bot, create an array with two elements, Network and Identity.
The network is used to sort out which nick belongs to which server for
the access.

For each bot array you have, you need to add it to the array being sent
through to create the engine instance. This is important you add the bot
if you want it to be created and properly processed.

All mods (found in ./mods/) are then loaded into the Event system, and
scheduled timers are added to the Scheduler system.

---------------
Creating a mod
---------------

To create a mod, copy from the ./mods/ModTemplate.py file. You can look
in ./lib/IrcBot.py to get an idea of the syntax for using the bot, and
other library files to see how the bot works overall.

---------------
Creating a scheduled instance
---------------

Like a mod, you can use the structure of the ./sched/TestEvent.py file as
a base. Set the name, the delay (in seconds), and switch whether it controls
a single bot or multiple bots. You can change this by removing the bot
declaration in the constructor for your Schedule event, and declare the
engine instance instead. Refer to how ./sched/AuthSys.py is initiated.

---------------
Identify your access
---------------

Simply type a period. '.' is the auth key to check a user's whois for
being identified. Note the access file is loaded once on start, so any
changes will not be loaded unless (a) an authenticated user performs
the "!reload" command in the Basic mod, or (b) the bot is restarted.

This method is used because I didn't want to check on a user's whois 
every message, so this will work for now. Suggestions welcome.
